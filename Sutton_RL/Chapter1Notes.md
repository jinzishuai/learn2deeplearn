# 1.1 Reinforcement Learning

## These two characteristics 
* trial-and-error search and 
* delayed reward

are the two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning.

## Maching Learning Paradigms

* supervised learning
* unsupervised learning
* reinforcement learning

# 1.3 Elements of Reinforcement Learning

* a policy: may be stochastic
* a reward signal: immediate
* a value function: long-term
* (optionally) a model of the environment
